CreditCardFraud Detection Project:
-This repository contains a project on credit card fraud detection, utilizing SQL for data querying and Power BI for data visualization. The dataset spans transactions over a period of time, highlighting both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Project Overview:
-The primary objective of this project is to analyze patterns and detect fraud within credit card transactions. By leveraging SQL, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to uncover key insights. The processed data is then visualized in Power BI to provide a clear, interactive dashboard showcasing fraud trends, high-risk transaction categories, and other critical insights.

Key Components:
-SQL Queries: Structured queries were used to filter, aggregate, and analyze transaction data to identify potentially fraudulent patterns.
-Power BI Dashboards: Visualizations were created to effectively communicate data insights and help stakeholders understand the trends and risks associated with credit card fraud.

Dataset:
-The project uses two files, fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv, covering transaction data from January 2019 to December 2020.

Key Insights:
-Analysis of transaction behavior patterns.
-Visualization of high-risk merchants, locations, and transaction amounts.
-Identification of peak periods and customer demographics prone to fraud.

Technology Stack:
-SQL for Data Processing
-Power BI for Data Visualization
